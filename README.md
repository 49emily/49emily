## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Emily (she/her)!

I'm a student at Stanford double-majoring in CS and [Art Practice](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gjs3cpn3r-245lZ_obt6YkLqLzuztpRD?usp=sharing)! I'm passionate about the intersection of tech and art (especially in Web3!). Most of all, I want to harness the power of AI and entrepreneurship for social and cultural good.


### ðŸ“« I'd love to talk to you!
